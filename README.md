# Fujitsu MB85RS256

This is a driver for the Fujitsu MB85RS256 FRAM for Linux.

The TI version has been tested with kernel 3.2 and 4.1.

The Freescale version has been tested with kernel 2.6.35.

If your platform is mainlined, start with the TI version.

Some edges are a bit rough but I've used both daily on multiple devices since 2016 without issue.
